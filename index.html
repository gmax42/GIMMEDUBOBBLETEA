    <h1>Gimme My Bubble Tea</h1>
    <h2>NOTICE: </h2>
    <p>Hello there, considering my amazing use of media and effort put into this site, I think this qualifies as a website suitable for bubble tea. With this considered, if you do not give me at least $7 worth of bubble tea from Chatime (any location is fine) within the next 31 days, you will have a talk with my willing proxy, Don Luciano, who would be very happy to extort and threaten ;) For any questions, please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0">this video  </a> </p>
